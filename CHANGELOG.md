  patch 1.36.0.20257.

## [1.6.13] - 2020-04-03

### Fixed

- Address the `-maze` command broken in 1.6.12.

## [1.6.12] - 2020-04-01

### Fixed

- Auras from gems gathered and then consumed in a combination continued to
  apply to other towers for the rest of the round.
- The `-maze` command could be used on Level 1 after placing all gems.

## [1.6.11] - 2020-03-19

### Fixed

- Swap could incur no cost when used as the last monster was killed.
- The map name would not appear on the friend's list.
- Minor UI changes related to 1.32.

## [1.6.10] - 2020-02-01

### Fixed

- A Warcraft III bug in 1.32.0 could cause desyncs and other map issues.
- Minor UI changes due to new 1.32 features (e.g. hotkeys).

## [1.6.9] - 2020-01-05

### Added

- `-extra` command:
  - This toggles Extra Chance on and off.
  - Can only be used before placing a gem at game start.

## [1.6.8] - 2019-12-15

### Fixed

- Towers no longer upgrade multiple times if the player has enough gold.

## [1.6.7] - 2019-11-03

### Fixed

- Units dying too quickly after spawning could break level advancement.
- Unit scale could be wrong on cancelling or finishing an upgrade.

## [1.6.6] - 2019-08-29

### Changed

- The small delay after selecting a target with swap has been removed.
  This allows quicker completion of the move.

### Fixed

- Unit pathing in multiplayer games should be less susceptible to
  stutters. To be fair, Warcraft III pathing is just bad in complex mazes
  such as those used in Gem.
- Minor board issues.
- Further tooltip improvements.

## [1.6.5] - 2019-08-16

### Fixed

- The Extra Chance target is intended to be immutable while placing gems.
  However, it could be cancelled, thus refunding gold and yielding the
  Extra Chance benefit to the placed gems.

## [1.6.4] - 2019-08-16

### Added

- `-bars` command:
  - This toggles status bars on and off for player owned towers. This
    applies only to the towers belonging to the player.

### Changed

- Status bars over towers are now hidden by default. This should cause
  less screen clutter when trying to view the bars of the monsters.

  recently used to combine and fulfill a recipe.
- Round progress can no longer show `100%` in situations where a player
  leaked or a monster is still alive.

## [1.6.3] - 2019-08-10

### Fixed

- The Poison ability on Emeralds and Jades has been corrected:
  - It was dealing `4` spell damage per second at all qualities and
    upgrade levels. It nows deals the stated damage.
  - It was incorrectly slowing units by `50%` instead of only `20%`.
- Actually shorten length of leak warning for all colors.

## [1.6.1] - 2019-08-06

  difference, if there was one.

## [1.5.2] - 2019-01-12

### Added

- Introduced a game identifier to help verify screenshot/replay pairing
  when submitting games to the leaderboard. This is not a unique game
  identifier.

### Changed

## [1.5.1] - 2018-11-24

  quality.

  support.

### Changed

- Combine has been split into distinct Combine (2x) and Combine (4x)
  buttons.
- A base slate can now stack upon any other base slate, except those of
  the same type. For example, a Range can stack on a Damage but not
  another Range. Stacking rules for combination slates remain the same.

    once the target has been hit.

    - As the bonus grows it will make it more likely to hit the target.
    - Failing to hit the target and selecting the same one in the next
      placement round will increase the bonus.
    - Not using Extra Chance for a placement round will cause the bonus to
      decrease.
    - Switching to a different target from the previous placement round
      does not alter the bonus.
    - At the maximum `5x` bonus, the player will only be offered gems
      related to their target.
  - For Perfects:
    - Sets the target to the selected Perfect, increasing chances to get
      all qualities of the chosen type.
    - Is superior to the old system at a bonus of `2x`. However, if one
      factors in the chance to make the target via Combine, it could be
      considered superior at a bonus of `1x`.
  - For Slates:
    - No longer gives slates directly.
    - Sets the target to the chosen base slate, increasing chances to get
      the component Normal and Flawed pieces of both base slates that make
      a combination.
    - The target slate is weighted more heavily than that of the other
      slate in its pair.
    - For slates with 2 Flawed pieces (e.g. Hold), it is superior to the
      old system at a bonus of `1x`. For slates with 3 Flawed pieces (e.g.
      Air), it is superior to the old system at a bonus of `0x`.

  following:
  - Poison Slate
  - Spell Slate
  - Elder Slate
  - Bloodstone

## [1.3.2] - 2017-04-05

### Fixed

- An incompatible change in the 1.28.0 patch broke behavior for the
  following:
  - Damage Slate
  - Hold Slate
  - Ancient Slate

## [1.3.1] - 2016-11-12

### Fixed

- Structures that accumulated 70+ kills were becoming spell immune. This
  broke the following functionality:
  - Disarming for Damage Slate, Hold Slate, and Ancient Slate;
  - The ability to swap.

## [1.3.0] - 2016-11-08

### Changed

- Hold Slate and Ancient Slate can now be moved in the middle of their
  stun.
- The `-debug` command has been reworked. It no longer targets any known

  command resolves a problem, then a bug report should be created.

### Fixed

  units that were stunned.
- A slate could still retain the ability to move even after moving due to
  another slate movement bug.
- Slates will no longer be damaged when attacking the ReRunner.
- Spamming Keep Slate, when offered multiple slates, could cause extra
  units to spawn. This made it possible to skip multiple rounds, assuming
  the units were killed.
- A Warcraft 3 bug could cause button spamming on dialog windows (e.g.
  Extra Chance) to disable a player's control, essentially ending their
  game.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-08-10

### Changed

- Slates can now be repaired.
- The result of a selection or combination action (e.g. Combine,
  Downgrade, etc.) will now automatically be selected for the player.
  Previously, only the result of Keep exhibited this behavior.
- A slate now ignores itself when performing slate stacking checks.

### Fixed

- Issuing multiple Combine orders too quickly could cause a rock to appear
  instead of the intended result, for a total of five rocks.
- Destroying all five placed gems would prevent the player from
  progressing.
- New slates could occasionally be missing the ability to move.

  full amount is returned.

  FPS and responsiveness for many players throughout the game.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-07-09

### Added

### Changed

- Player control is no longer disabled during settings selection.
- No one is required to be Red anymore.

  next player. If all players pass, then the default settings are used.
- The game timer no longer runs during game settings selection.
- Board player colors now match Warcraft 3 in-game colors.
- The board's width changes according to player name length. This is only
  accurate for widescreen (i.e. `16:9` aspect ratio).
- The `-debug` command no longer checks Opal aura levels.
- The Quests tab is now labeled Information and has been reworked.

### Fixed

- The game no longer remains frozen if settings are not selected.
- Landing a killing blow at the moment a recipe was combined could cause
  the kill to not be registered. This would prevent the player from
  progressing further.

  experience unexpected behavior.
