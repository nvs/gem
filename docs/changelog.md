## [1.3.3] - 2017-04-06

    - Spell Slate
    - Elder Slate
    - Bloodstone

## [1.3.2] - 2017-04-05

### Fixed
- An incompatible change in the 1.28.0 patch broke behavior for the following:
    - Damage Slate
    - Hold Slate
    - Ancient Slate

## [1.3.1] - 2016-11-12

### Fixed
- Structures that accumulated 70+ kills were becoming spell immune. This broke
  the following functionality:
    - Disarming for Damage Slate, Hold Slate, and Ancient Slate;
    - The ability to swap.

## [1.3.0] - 2016-11-08

### Changed
- Hold Slate and Ancient Slate can now be moved in the middle of their stun.
- The `-debug` command has been reworked. It no longer targets any known bugs.
  Instead, it provides the ability to recover from a variety of issues (e.g.
  user interface and control issues). In short, if this command resolves a
  problem, then a bug report should be created.

### Fixed
- The bug known as the 'glitch' has been removed.
- Creeps should no longer get stuck at the spawn point.
- Spawning creeps will no longer cluster during lag or pauses.
- A rare desync related to using Keep has been resolved.
- Debuffs (e.g. armor reductions) will no longer have their durations
  unnaturally extended by stuns.
- The duration of stuns and certain slate abilities will no longer be
  susceptible to lag and pauses.
- Certain types of damage (most notably area of effect) did not apply to units
  that were stunned.
- A slate could still retain the ability to move even after moving due to
  another slate movement bug.
- Slates will no longer be damaged when attacking the ReRunner.
- Spamming Keep Slate, when offered multiple slates, could cause extra units
  to spawn. This made it possible to skip multiple rounds, assuming the units
  were killed.
- Spamming buttons on dialog windows (e.g. Extra Chance) could cause a
  player's control to be disabled, essentially ending their game.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-08-10

### Changed
- Slates can now be repaired.
- The result of a selection or combination action (e.g. Combine, Downgrade,
  etc.) will now automatically be selected for the player. Previously, only
  the result of Keep exhibited this behavior.
- A slate now ignores itself when performing slate stacking checks.

### Fixed
- Resolved issues that broke save/load compatibility.
- Issuing multiple Combine orders too quickly could cause a rock to appear
  instead of the intended result, for a total of five rocks.
- Destroying all five placed gems would prevent the player from progressing.
- New slates could occasionally be missing the ability to move.
- Recently moved slates could retain their ability to move.
- Slates could stack on rare occasions.
- When multiple of the same slate appears due to Extra Chance, the ability to
  Combine will no longer appear.

## [1.1.0] - 2016-07-19

### Changed
- Cancelling an upgrade previously returned only a partial refund. Now the
  full amount is returned.

### Fixed
- Leaks related to special effects have been resolved. This will increase FPS
  and responsiveness for many players throughout the game.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-07-09

### Added
- A host bot can now specify the game mode via HCL, thus bypassing the need
  for players to select game settings.
- The `-zoom` command has been added.
- A countdown has been introduced that begins after settings have been
  selected, marking the start of the game.

### Removed
- All cheat commands and ban lists have been removed.
- Classic mode has been removed.
- The introduction has been removed.

### Changed
- Player control is no longer disabled during settings selection.
- No one is required to be Red anymore.
- There is now a default difficulty: Extreme.
- When hosted without HCL, players (in lobby order) will be asked to select
  game settings. If too much elapses, selection will pass to the next player.
  If all players pass, then the default settings are used.
- The game timer no longer runs during game settings selection.
- Board player colors now match Warcraft 3 in-game colors.
- The board's width changes according to player name length. This is only
  accurate for widescreen (i.e. `16:9` aspect ratio).
- The `-debug` command no longer checks Opal aura levels.
- The Quests tab is now labeled Information and has been reworked.

### Fixed
- The game no longer remains frozen if settings are not selected.
- Landing a killing blow at the moment a recipe was combined could cause the
  kill to not be registered. This would prevent the player from progressing
  further.
- Taking another player's kill no longer prevents that player from progressing
  further. Also, the player that stole the kill will no longer experience
  unexpected behavior.
- Collecting multiple pieces of the same recipe will no longer leave some of
  those pieces unusable.
- The board no longer disappears if too much time passes during settings
  selection.
- Absent players no longer occupy a row in the board.
- Using Extra Chance when already applied will no longer cause the player to
  lose gold.

- The board will appear maximized on game start.
- The Information tab will no longer flash throughout the game.
- The Damage Test can no longer spawn unleveled.
